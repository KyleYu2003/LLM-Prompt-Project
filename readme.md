Welcome to Assignment1 sub-repo

Here we will have the code and data template for assignment 1, feel free to modify it or code it from scratch

You are encouraged  to complete one and only one task listed below.

- Task1: LLMs as a knowledgeable doctor
- Task2: LLMs for AI feedback
- Task3: LLMs as a data quality evaluator
- Task4: Using LLMs to remove sensitive info
- Task5: Jailbreak
- Task6: Prompt Engineering for public benchmark
- Task7: Any other topics

As examples, we show the pipeline, code, and data for Task 1 and Task 2.

### Dependecy
pip install retrying, openai==0.28, urllib3==1.25.11, tqdm, jsonlines

### The most basic practice
  1. run python OpenAIGPT.py
       - you can try different args introduced by tutorial
       - notion that if you change "n=1", you may also need adjust function(__post_process)   
  2. OpenAIGPT_datagen_multithread.py is for multi-threaded parallel generation of data of specific task.
       - learn about this code in task1/task2 directory
